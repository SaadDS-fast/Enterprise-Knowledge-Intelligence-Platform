| Area | Test | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Backend | Compilation | Pass | `.venv/bin/python -m compileall app tests` |
| Backend | Ruff lint | Pass | `.venv/bin/ruff check app tests` |
| Backend | Ruff format | Pass | `.venv/bin/ruff format --check app tests` |
| Backend | Unit/integration/security tests | Pass | `50 passed, 2 skipped` |
| Backend | Coverage | Pass | `74%` total coverage |
| Database | Alembic drift | Pass | Docker PostgreSQL `alembic check`: no new upgrade operations |
| Runtime | Docker stack | Pass | Backend, frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, workers, Prometheus, Grafana, and OTel running |
| Runtime | Completed-task retry | Pass | Same request id, 1 chunk, 1 embedded chunk, no asyncpg/event-loop log matches |

| Runtime | Orphan retry jobs | Pass | `0` jobs in `retry_pending` or `dispatch_failed` after recovery |
| Runtime | MinIO outage | Pass | Sanitized 500 and no document row persisted |
| Observability | Prometheus targets | Pass | `backend:8000`, `ingestion-worker:9101`, `evaluation-worker:9102`, `report-worker:9103` all `up=1` |
| Observability | Worker metrics | Pass | `ekip_worker_tasks_completed_total{worker_role="ingestion"} = 4` |
| Frontend | Lint | Pass | 0 errors, 1 existing Fast Refresh warning |
| Frontend | Typecheck | Pass | `npm run typecheck` |
| Frontend | Unit/component tests | Pass | 5 files, 19 tests passed |

| Frontend | Build | Pass | `npm run build` |
| Security | Bandit | Pass | No issues |
| Security | pip-audit | Pass | No known vulnerabilities for audited PyPI packages |
| Security | npm audit | Pass | 0 vulnerabilities |
| Agent | State transitions | Pass | Valid and invalid transition tests |
| Agent | Deterministic planner | Pass | Structured internal search + evidence verifier plan |
| Agent | Tool policy | Pass | Unknown tool, forbidden scope change, disabled/network placeholders rejected |
| Agent | Budgets and timeout | Pass | Step budget and per-tool timeout tests |
| Agent | Feature flag | Pass | `AGENTIC_RAG_ENABLED=false` returns clear disabled response |
| Agent | Persistence safety | Pass | Runs, steps, tool calls, and audit events store operational summaries only |
| Agent | Tenant/workspace isolation | Pass | Cross-workspace run lookup returns 404 |
| Agent | Cancellation | Pass | Cancelled orchestrator run persisted as `cancelled` |
| Regression | Existing search endpoint | Pass | `/api/v1/search` still returns answer and retrieval diagnosis |
| Migration | Agent tables | Pass | Disposable SQLite Alembic `upgrade head` reached `c8f4a2d91b77` |
| Docker | Smoke | Pass | `docker compose config`; existing observability stack healthy |

## Notes

- `npm run test` initially collected `tests/e2e/runtime.spec.ts`; `vitest.config.ts` now excludes `tests/e2e/**`.
- Host-side API and browser validation required sandbox escalation to reach Docker-published localhost ports.
